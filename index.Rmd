## *To Do* in the morning: self-study

You need to complete before 13h today:

- See information provided via blackboard in the section course description: lesson 1! 
You need to have *RStudio Desktop* (Free) and *R* (Free) installed on your personal computer. Or work from a Wageningen University PC where this should normally be available.

- For more information about *R* and *RStudio* installation: see [Geo-scripting system set-up](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/system_setup/)

- If you have questions you can use the [Question and Answer Website of the Geo-scripting course](http://www.geo-informatie.nl/courses/grs33806/question2answer/). 
**Try to ask or answer a question today.** We will explain how this can be used today.


## Objective and Learning outcomes of today:

- Refreshing R skills and assessing scripting skills to see if you have the 
necessary scripting skills to continue with the course
- Able to write a function
- Know how to visualise data (spatial map) in R

# Basic *R* and *RStudio* setup {#gettingstarted}

This preliminary section will cover some basic details about *R*. For this course we will use Rstudio to write and run scripts.
In case you are working on your own computer and would like to know how to install *R* and *RStudio*: [https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/system_setup/](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/system_setup/).

## Getting started with *RStudio* and *R* on your own computer.

A summary youtube movie about how to use Rstudio and writing a function is here: [Intro to RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPk6-3prknk). Have a look at this movie if you do not know how to work with RStudio and then do the following section. See the following tutorial for a [short introduction on the RStudio interface](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf).
 
Now, Open RStudio and type the following script in the R console of **RStudio**:

**Pro Tip**:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Never set the following in your script! this would make the script not reproducible by others
setwd('path')
```
The use of `setwd` is not a good practice in scripts without a very, very good reason. The users are aware of the environment and working directories and scripts should not try to outsmart the users.

```{r}
a <- 1
a
```

The first line you passed to the console created a new object named  $a$ in memory.
The symbol '<-' is somewhat equivalent to an equal sign but recommended as it is used internally. In the second line you printed $a$ to the console by simply typing it's name.

**What is the class of this object?**

```{r}
class(a)
```

You now have requested the class attribute of $a$ and the console has returned the attribute: numeric. R possesses a simple mechanism to support an object-oriented style of programming. All objects ($a$ in this case) have a class attribute assigned to them. R is quite forgiving and will assign a class to an object even if you haven't specified one (as you didn't in this case). Classes are a very important feature of the R environment. Any function or method that is applied to an object takes into account its class and uses this information to determine the correct course of action.

## Set Your Working Directory

Let's do some basic set up first.

- Create a folder which will be your working directory e.g. `Lesson1`
- Create an R script within that folder
- Set your working directory to the `Lesson1` folder
- Create a `data` folder within your working directory

Via Rstudio you can set your working directory via, if you have save your R script to your working directory:
![](figs/setwd_rstudiotip.png)

Then you can use this line to load your data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datdir <- file.path("data") # Path
```

# Basic *R* knowledge useful for Geo-Scripting
Scripting with *R* to handle spatial problems requires a core set of basic *R* skills. To prepare you well for the coming weeks, we've summarized what we think are important skills for geo scripting below. 

## Vector handling and vector arithmetic
You'll be introduced in a following lesson with the *raster* package and the raster classes that have been developed as part of that package. All objects that belong to the class `raster` are **vectors** with a few more spatial attributes. 

**In *R* we call a collection of numbers a vector.** 

As a consequence, handling vectors is a crucial skill for processing raster data in *R*.

Reference manual for vector handling and vector arithmetic can be found [here](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Simple-manipulations-numbers-and-vectors).

```{r}
## Create a vector
a <- c(3,6,8,1)
a

## Any mathematical operation can be performed on vectors
(b <- a * 2)
(d <- a + 6)

## Two vectors of same length can also be added with each other
(e <- a + b)
```

### Value replacement

```{r}
## Values in a vector that satisfy a certain condition can be replaced by other values
a <- c(2,5,2,5,6,9,2,12)

## Values inferior or equal to 5 are replaced by 0
a[a <= 5] <- 0
a

## Condition can be defined using another vector of equal length
a <- c(2,5,2,5,6,9,2,12)
b <- c(1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0)

## Change the values of a based on b values
a[b == 0] <- NA
a
```

More complex value replacement:

```{r}
a <- c(2,5,2,5,6,9,2,12)
b <- c(1,1,2,1,0,0,1,2)
## a values at which b is equal to either 0 or 1 are replaced by NA
a[b %in% c(0,1)] <- NA
a
```

> **Question 1:** How do I replace values in `b` by 3 at which `a` is 6, 9 and 12?

## Character vector handling

When working with real data, such as shapefiles or satellite imagery, the data always needs to be read from files. File names and file paths define the location of a file on a computer hard drive. A great advantage of scripting is that locating data, reading and writing data can be fairly easily automated (generate automatic file names, recognise patterns in file names, etc). That requires from the user some basic **string** handling skills.

Key functions for handling character strings are listed below:

* `list.files()`: to list files in a directory.
* `glob2rx()`: to select files using a wildcard. Note: if you know regular expressions, you do not need that function. But most people are more comfortable working with wildcards.
* `paste()`, `paste0()`, `sprintf()`: useful to combine vectors e.g. to create a filename.
* `strsplit()`: to split up a string.

### Example of `list.files()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd() # check your working directory
list.files() # list the files available in this directory
```

> **Question 2**: List the directories in your working directory.

### Example of `glob2rx()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## List all .txt files in working directory
list.files(getwd(), pattern = glob2rx("*.txt"))
```

### Example of `paste()` and `paste0()`

```{r}
## two handy examples
paste("Today is", date())
paste0("A", 1:6)
```

> **Question 3**: Create one variable containing a sentence `"geo-scripting is fun"`, by combining `a`, `b`, and `c`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a <- "geo-scripting"
b <- "is"
c <- "fun"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## what if you only have d, defined as a list?
d <- list(a, b, c)
paste(d) ## this is not good
```

### Example of `strsplit()`

```{r}
# I have the following character string
name <- 'today_is_friday_12-12-2014'

# I want to extract the date contained in it, I can split it based on the underscores and the fourth element should be the date
date0 <- unlist(strsplit('today_is_friday_12-12-2014', split = '_'))[4]

# Which can then be formatted as a date object (until now it is a character string)
class(date0)
(date <- as.Date(date0, format = '%m-%d-%Y'))
class(date)
```

> **Question 4**: How do we select friday from the `name` variable?

See also `?substr`, this can be handy too.

## Reading and writing data

In the following lessons we will show you how you can read and write different spatial objects (e.g. vector and raster files).

Here, an example is given how you can read (import into *R*) and write a text file (i.e. export from *R*).

The most common way to read in spread sheet tables is with the `read.csv()` command.
However you can read in virtually any type of text file. Type `?read.table` in your console for some other examples.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# getwd() ## Check your working directory
(test <- c(1:5, "6,7", "8,9,10"))
write.csv(test, file = "testing.csv") # Write to your working directory
rm(test) # Remove the variable "test" from the R working environment
ls() # Check the objective in the working environment
(test = read.csv("testing.csv")) # Read from your working directory
```

> **Question 5**: Do you know how to read an *Excel* file into *R*? 
What are the different options? How can you find help?

## Writing a function

It is hard to unleash the full potential of R without writing your own functions. Luckily it's very easy to do. Here are some trivial examples:

```{r}
## Put the function arguments in () and the evaluation in {}
add <- function(x){
  x + 1
}
add(4)
```

Set the default argument values for your function:

```{r}
add <- function(x = 5) {
  z <- x + 1
  return(z)
}
add()
add(6)
```

That's about all there is to it. The function will generally return the result of the last line that was evaluated.

> **Question 6**: How do you write a function that returns `x` and `z`?

Now, let's declare a new object, a new function, `newfunc` (this is just a name and if you like you can give this function another name). Appearing in the first set of brackets is an argument list that specifies (in this case) two names. The value of the function appears within the second set of brackets where the process applied to the named objects from the argument list is defined.

```{r}
newfunc <- function(x, y) {
  z <- 2*x + y
  return(c(z,x,y))
}
a2b <- newfunc(2, 4)
a2b
```

Next, a new object `a2b` is created which contains the result of applying `newfunc` to the two objects you have defined earlier. The second last R command prints this new object to the console. Finally, you can now remove the objects you have created to make room for the next exercise by selecting and running the last line of the code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(a, newfunc, a2b)
```

## Creating a map within *R* - a simple demo

Here is an example of how you can create a map in *R*. It is a function to get *public* data from anywhere in the world. See help of the `getData` function in the `raster` package.


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(raster)
?getData
?raster::getData
```

Read the help to find out how we can find the country codes.

> **Question 7**: What is the country code of Belgium?

More info about the datasets see [Global Adminstrative Areas database (GADM)](http://www.gadm.org).

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
raster::getData("ISO3")
```

Now we will download the administrative boundaries of the Philippines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datdir <- 'data'
dir.create(datdir, showWarnings = FALSE)
adm <- raster::getData("GADM", country = "PHL",
                       level = 2, path = datdir)
plot(adm[adm$NAME_1 == "Tarlac",])
```

```{r loadrda, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
datdir <- 'data'
if (!file.exists(datdir)) { dir.create(datdir)}
if (!file.exists(file.path(datdir, "PHL_adm2.RData"))) {
  adm <- raster::getData("GADM", country = "PHL", level=2, path = "data/")
} else {
  load(file.path(datdir, "PHL_adm2.RData"))
  adm <- gadm
}
```

Try to understand the code below, and let me know if you have questions. Feel free to use this code as an example and use this for the excercise below.

```{r phil, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
mar <- adm[adm$NAME_1 == "Marinduque",]
plot(mar, bg = "dodgerblue", axes=TRUE)
plot(mar, lwd = 10, border = "skyblue", add=TRUE)
plot(mar, col = "green4", add = TRUE)
grid()
box()
invisible(text(getSpPPolygonsLabptSlots(mar),
labels = as.character(mar$NAME_2), cex = 1.1, col = "white", font = 2))
mtext(side = 3, line = 1, "Provincial Map of Marinduque", cex = 2)
mtext(side = 1, "Longitude", line = 2.5, cex=1.1)
mtext(side = 2, "Latitude", line = 2.5, cex=1.1)
mtext(side = 1, line = -2,
"Projection: Geographic\n
Coordinate System: WGS 1984    \n
Data Source: GADM.org    ", adj = 1, cex = 0.5, col = "grey20")
```

# Lesson 1 exercise

- Write your own function to create a spatial map for a country of **your choice** that is:
    - clearly structured
    - reproducible by another team on their computer
    - documented script

- To do's with the script:
    - Define the function.
    - Demonstrate the function (i.e. use it to plot a map of a country and a certain level as an example).
    - Keep it simple (!) e.g. just plot the adminstrative boundaries - as the focus on it on **reproducible scripting**
    - The function should accept `country` and `level` as input arguments.
    - **Bonus**: Getting the administrative labels and legend correct.
    - Use the script review center in BlackBoard to submit your script in time (see details via blackboard) as text - do not use an attachement. 

- Tips to make sure the script is **reproducible**, **structured**, and **documented**: 
    - Do not use any paths e.g. `mydocument/John/blabla` specific for your computer. 
    In this excercise you should not need any paths:
    - Do not set the working directory (see above i.e. also specific to your computer).
    - Use the script template below
    - [More info about how to create a reproducible example](https://gist.github.com/hadley/270442)

## Submission

See description in BlackBoard - follow the file naming precisely.

## **Reviewing**

- Each team has to review one script of the other team before **11:00**

- See rubric available via this google doc: [Rubric Lesson 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bVqVYNDLN8O4Ik0YX6wrk4AMytAwEtlSwWz2EHdB8_I/edit?usp=sharing)

- The teams need to use this rubric and fill in the *form* as a guideline and copy "as text" (*not as a document or attachement*) within the blackboard box.

- The Geo-scripting team will assess the quality of the review done by each team.

Script template:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Name: Team name and members of the team
# Date: 7 January 2019

# Import packages
library(raster)
# Define the function

# An example based on that function
```

# Pro-tip !!! (optional)

## Creating documented reports

A great way to avoid clicking and copy pasting is to create a script that combines text (explanation of your script, introduction, or something else) and a R script and creates a report as an html file.

You can create an `.html` from a`.Rmd` file. Click on the following [link](https://rpubs.com/about/getting-started) for getting started and publishing your html to the www.

### RStudio

* In RStudio, create a new R Markdown document by choosing File | New | R Markdown
    * select HTML as a default output format (see screenshot)

![](figs/DefaultOutput_Format.png)

In the white parts of the R Markdown you can type anything (such as text or titles), which will not be run as a script. In the grey boxes you can type your code. Running the code can be done with the play button ("run curent chunk") on the right top side of the grey box or by clicking in the RMD you can use the shortcut ctrl + shift + enter to run the whole code chunk. This combination of text and code in R Markdown is very user friendly and makes it easy to make documents with nice visualizations or nicely documented code.

* Click the Knit HTML button in the doc toolbar to preview your document such as the assignment of today.

![](figs/KnitHTML.png)

* In the preview window, click the Publish button.

## Dataframe manipulation
This section is also just a draft and should be further elaborated
One central object class of R is the dataframes. The spatial vector classes of R are usually built around dataframes as well, as a consequence, all dataframe manipulation functions and methods are also highly relevant when dealing with spatial vector data in R.

* `str()`
* `subset()`
* `cbind()`, `rbind()`
* Methods with `[,]`, `[,] <-`
* `merge()`

# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
# ## load the googleVis package
# suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))
# ## create the scatter chart
# sc <- gvisScatterChart(data=df,
#                         options=list(width=300, height=300, 
#                                      legend='none',
#                                      hAxis="{title:'x'}",
#                                      vAxis="{title:'y'}")
#           )
# plot(sc)
# ```
# 
# ```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# print(sc, "chart")  ## same as cat(sc$html$chart)
# ```
-->
