 ![All the best for 2015)`](figs/champ.jpg)
 
## `To Do` in the morning: self-study

If you are working on your own laptop you need to install `Rstudio` and `R`. See here for info how to do that: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

You need to complete before 12 on 5/01/2015:

- A R-refresher and self-test: http://tryr.codeschool.com/. How much time does it take you to complete the full 8 chapters of this *R basics online course* (you can sign in, and complete all chapters here)? Send an e-mail to *Jan Verbesselt* with the proof that you have completed all chapters and challenges. (e.g. a screenshot or a Twitter tweet that you completed the course)

- Fill in the following questionnaire (after finishing the R-refresher): http://goo.gl/forms/fZk2c8J4t4

- Read and do the `getting started with R section` ([see below](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/Scripting4GeoIntro/#gettingstarted))

In the morning you can work from home or can come to the PC38 room, GAIA. 
You need to have Rstudio Desktop (Free) and R (Free) installed on your laptop (see http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ ). For more information see [Geo-scripting system set-up](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/system_setup/)

If you have questions that fellow students can help you with you can use the [Question and Answer Website of the Geo-scripting course](http://www.geo-informatie.nl/courses/grs50406/question2answer/index.php?qa=questions). **Try it out!** I will explain how this can be used during this course at 1330 today in PC38.

## Objective and Learning outcomes of today:

Introduction to the course, planning, teamwork, and projectweek:

# Getting started with R scripting {#gettingstarted}

## Online help and tutorial

This preliminary section will cover some basic details about R. For this course we will use Rstudio to write and run scripts.

# Basic R and RStudio setup

## Getting started with Rstudio and R on your own computer.

A summary youtube movie about how to use `Rstudio` and writing a function is here: [Intro to Rstudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPk6-3prknk). Have a look at this movie if you do not know how to work with `Rstudio` and then do the following section. See the following tutorial for a [short introduction on the Rstudio interface](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf).
 
Now, Open `Rstudio` and type the following script in the R console of **Rstudio**:

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
rm(list = ls())  # Clear the workspace!
ls() ## no objects left in the workspace
```

A good way to start most R scripts

```{r
a <- 1
a
```

The first line you passed to the console created a new object named  $a$ in memory.
The symbol '<-' is somewhat equivalent to an equal sign but recommended as it is used internally. In the second line you printed $a$ to the console by simply typing it's name.

**What is the class of this object?**

```{r
class(a)
```

You now have requested the class attribute of $a$ and the console has returned the attribute: numeric. R possesses a simple mechanism to support an object-oriented style of programming. All objects ($a$ in this case) have a class attribute assigned to them. R is quite forgiving and will assign a class to an object even if you haven't specified one (as you didn't in this case). Classes are a very important feature of the R environment. Any function or method that is applied to an object takes into account its class and uses this information to determine the correct course of action.

## Set Your Working Directory

Let's do some basic set up first.

- Create a folder which will be your working directory e.g. Lesson1
- Create an R script within that folder
- Set your working directory to the Lesson1 folder
- Create a $data$ folder within your working directory

In the code block below type in the file path to where your data is being held and then (if you want) use the setwd() (set working directory) command to give R a default location to look for data files.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("yourworkingdirectory")
# This sets the working directory (where R looks for files)
getwd() # Double check your working directory
datdir <- file.path("data") ## path
```

# Basic R knowledge usefull for Geo-Scripting
Scripting with R to handle spatial problems requires a core set of basic R skills. To prepare you well for the coming weeks, we've summarized what we think are important skills for geo scripting below. 

## Vector handling and vector arithmetic
You'll be introduced in a following lesson with the raster package and the raster classes that have been developped as part of that package. All objects that belong to the class `raster` are **vectors** with a few more spatial attributes. 

**In `R` we call a collection of number a vector.** 

As a consequence, handling vector is a crucial skill for processing raster data in R.

Reference manual for vector handling and vector arithmetic can be found [here](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Simple-manipulations-numbers-and-vectors).

```{r}
# Create a vector
a <- c(3,6,8,1)
a

# Any mathematical operation can be performed on vectors
(b <- a * 2)
(d <- a + 6)

# Two vectors of same length can also be added with each others
(e <- a + b)
```

Value replacement

```{r}
# Values in a vector that satisfy a certain condition can be replaced by other values
a <- c(2,5,2,5,6,9,2,12)

# Values inferior or equal to 5 are replaced by 0
a[a <= 5] <- 0
a

# Condition can be defined using another vector of equal length
a <- c(2,5,2,5,6,9,2,12)
b <- c(1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0)

# Change the values of a based on b values
a[b == 0] <- NA
a
```

More complex value replacement:

```{r}
a <- c(2,5,2,5,6,9,2,12)
b <- c(1,1,2,1,0,0,1,2)
# a values at which b is equal to either 0 or 1 are replaced by NA
a[b %in% c(0,1)] <- NA
a
```

**Question:** How do I replace values in `b` by 3 at which `a` is 6, 9 and 12?
(just note down these questions as they will be discussed during the lesson at 1330 on monday)

## Character vector handling

When working with *real* data, such as shapefiles or satellite imagery, the data always need to be read from files. File names and file paths define the location of a file on a computer hard drive. A great advantage of scripting is that locating data, reading and writing data can be fairly easily automated (generate automatic file names, recognise patterns in file names, etc). That requires from the user some basic **string** handling skills.

Key functions for handling character strings are listed below:

* `list.files()`: to list files in a directory
* `paste()`, `paste0()`, `sprintf()`: useful to combine vectors e.g. to create a filename
* `strsplit()`: to split up a string

<!---
* Loïc - I did not add this yet - as it requires just a touch more of an explanation - looking for a simple example linked with an application.
* `glob2rx()`:  Note: if you know regular expressions, you do not need that function. But most people are more comfortable working with wildcards.
-->

### Example of `list.files()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd() ## check your working directory
list.files() ## list the files available in this directory
```

**Question**: List the directories in your working directory

### Example of `paste()`

```{r}
## two handy examples
paste("Today is", date())
paste("A", 1:6, sep = "")
```

**Question**: create one variable containing a sentence, based on a, b, or c:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

"geo-scripting is fun" # by combining a, b, an c
a <- "geo-scripting"
b <- "is"
c <- "fun"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## what if you only have d, defined as a list?
d <- list(a, b, c)
paste(d) ## this is not good
```

### Example of `strsplit()`

```{r}
# I have the following character string
name <- 'today_is_friday_12-12-2014'

# I want to extract the date contained in it, I can split it based on the underscores and the fourth element should be the date
date0 <- unlist(strsplit('today_is_friday_12-12-2014', split = '_'))[4]

# Which can then be formatted as a date object (until now it is a character string)
class(date0)
(date <- as.Date(date0, format = '%m-%d-%Y'))
class(date)
```

**Question**: How do we select friday from the `name` variable?

See also `?substr`, this can be handy to.

## Reading and writing data

In the following lessons we will show you how you can read and write different spatial objects (e.g. vector and raster files).

Here, an example is giving how can read (import in R) and write a text file (i.e. export from R).

The most common way to read in spread sheet tables is with the `read.csv()` command.
However you can read in virtually any type of text file. Type `?read.table` in your console for some other examples.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# getwd() ## check your working directory
test <- c(1:5, "6,7", "8,9,10")
print(test)
write.csv(test, file = "testing.csv") ## write to your working directory
rm(test) ## we remove test from the R working environment
ls() ## check the objective in the working environment
read.csv("testing.csv") ## read from your working directory
```

**Question**: Do you know how to read an excell file into R? 
What are the different options? How do you find help? (5mins)

## Writing a function

It is hard to unleash the full potential of R without writing your own functions. Luckily it's very easy to do. Here are some trivial examples:

```{r}
# put the function arguments in () and the evaluation in {}
add <- function(x){
  x + 1
}
add(4)
```

Set the default values for your function

```{r}
add <- function(x = 5) {
  z <- x + 1
  return(z)
}
add()
add(6)
```

That's about all there is to it. The function will generally return the result of the last line that was evaluated.

**Question**: How do you write a function that returns x and z?

Now, let's declares a new object, a new function, `newfunc` (this is just a name and if you like you can give this function another name). Appearing in the first set of brackets is an argument list that specifies (in this case) two names. The value of the function appears within the second set of brackets where the process applied to the named objects from the argument list is defined.

```{r}
newfunc <- function(x, y) {
  z <- 2*x + y
  return(c(z,x,y))
}
a2b <- newfunc(2, 4)
a2b
rm(a, newfunc, a2b)
```

Next, a new object `a2b` is created which contains the result of applying `newfunc` to the two objects you have defined earlier. The second last R command prints this new object to the console. Finally, you can now remove the objects you have created to make room for the next exercise by selecting and running the last line of the code.

## Creating a map within R - a simple demo

Here is an example of how you can create a map in R. Download data from the Global Adminstrative Areas Data base ([GADM](/http://www.gadm.org)).

There is a function do get *public* data from anywhere in the world. See help of the getData funciton in the `raster` package:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(raster)
?getData
?raster::getData
```

Read the help to find out how we can find the country codes? \\

**Question**:What is the country code of Belgium?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
raster::getData("ISO3")
```

Now we will download the administrative boundaries of the Philippines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datdir <- 'data'
if (!file.exists(datdir)) { dir.create(datdir)}
adm <- raster::getData("GADM", country = "PHL",
                       level = 2, path = datdir)
plot(adm[adm$NAME_1 == "Tarlac",])
```

```{r loadrda, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
datdir <- 'data'
if (!file.exists(datdir)) { dir.create(datdir)}
if (!file.exists(file.path(datdir, "PHL_adm2.RData"))) {
  adm <- raster::getData("GADM", country = "PHL", level=2, path = "data/")
} else {
  load(file.path(datdir, "PHL_adm2.RData"))
  adm <- gadm
}
```

Try to understand the code below, and let me know if you have questions. Feel free to use this code as an example and use this for the excercise below.

```{r phil, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
mar <- adm[adm$NAME_1 == "Marinduque",]
plot(mar, bg = "dodgerblue", axes=T)
plot(mar, lwd = 10, border = "skyblue", add=T)
plot(mar, col = "green4", add = T)
grid()
box()
invisible(text(getSpPPolygonsLabptSlots(mar),
labels = as.character(mar$NAME_2), cex = 1.1, col = "white", font = 2))
mtext(side = 3, line = 1, "Provincial Map of Marinduque", cex = 2)
mtext(side = 1, "Longitude", line = 2.5, cex=1.1)
mtext(side = 2, "Latitude", line = 2.5, cex=1.1)
text(122.08, 13.22, "Projection: Geographic\n
Coordinate System: WGS 1984\n
Data Source: GADM.org", adj = c(0, 0), cex = 0.7, col = "grey20")
```



# Excercise lesson 1

**Write your own function to create a map**. Submit a clear, reproducible, and documented script containing a function to create a spatial map for a country of your choice:

- define a function
- demonstrate the function (i.e. use it to plot a map of a country and a certain level as an example)
- keep it simple (!) e.g. just plot the adminstrative boundaries
- The function should accept `country` and `level` as input arguments 
- Optional (for a bonus):Getting the administrative labels and legend correct.
- Send the script to another team and let them test it (for the afternoon, after we have set-up the team)! Does it work yes/no? If yes, you can send it by e-mail.
- Copy and paste the documented script within an e-mail (no html)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Name: Team name and members of the team
# Date: December 2014

# Import packages
library(raster)

# Define the function


# An example based on that function
```

- Tips: 
    - Do not use any "paths" e.g. 'mydocument/John/blabla' specific for your computer. In this excercise you should not need any paths
    - do not set the working directory (see above i.e. also specific to your computer)
    - Use the script template above

- submit by e-mail to me before 10.30u `6/01/15`

## Assessment - and criteria for the excercise

It needs to work (yes/no), when we copy it to our R environment and run. If it does not work it is not ok.

## Dataframe manipulation
This section is also just a draft and should be further elaborated
One central object class of R is the dataframes. The spatial vector classes of R are usually built around dataframes as well, as a consequence, all dataframe manipulation functions and methods are also highly relevant when dealing with spatial vector data in R.

* `str()`
* `subset()`
* `cbind()`, `rbind()`
* Methods with `[,]`, `[,] <-`
* `merge()`

# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
# ## load the googleVis package
# suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))
# ## create the scatter chart
# sc <- gvisScatterChart(data=df,
#                         options=list(width=300, height=300, 
#                                      legend='none',
#                                      hAxis="{title:'x'}",
#                                      vAxis="{title:'y'}")
#           )
# plot(sc)
# ```
# 
# ```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# print(sc, "chart")  ## same as cat(sc$html$chart)
# ```
